Title,Body
"Define JaLM MVP scope + success criteria","Goal: Write a 1-page spec that defines MVP features (syntax subset, types, effects, structured concurrency, web server), non-goals, and a demo app target (hello + JSON route + middleware + tests)."
"Pick core syntax + write JaLM grammar v0","Goal: Produce an unambiguous EBNF (or PEG) for JaLM v0 including modules, imports, functions, structs/enums, pattern matching, if/for, async/task constructs, and effect annotations."
"Design JaLM type system v0","Goal: Specify primitive types, structs, enums, generics (if any), option/result, and type inference rules (or explicit typing rules) sufficient to type-check MVP programs."
"Design effect system (IO/NET/FS/TIME/RAND/FFI)","Goal: Define how effects are declared on functions, how they compose, how the compiler enforces them, and the minimal effect set needed for web apps."
"Define structured concurrency model","Goal: Specify task scopes, cancellation propagation, timeouts, error aggregation, and join semantics; document examples for server request handling."
"Define module system + project layout","Goal: Decide directory structure, module naming, import resolution, visibility (public/private), and how packages map to modules."
"Implement JaLM parser","Goal: Build a parser that converts JaLM source into an AST with precise span info for diagnostics; include round-trip tests for key constructs."
"Implement canonical formatter (jalmt fmt)","Goal: Create a deterministic formatter so there is exactly one valid style; integrate with parser AST and ensure idempotence."
"Implement type checker","Goal: Type-check JaLM v0 programs with clear errors (expected vs actual types) and machine-readable diagnostic codes."
"Implement effect checker","Goal: Enforce effect annotations and raise errors on undeclared effects; include examples for net/http and fs usage."
"Define JaLM MIR (mid-level IR) for WASM backend","Goal: Design a typed, lowered IR that makes codegen straightforward (control flow graph, calls, locals, effects metadata)."
"Implement WASM codegen (minimum viable)","Goal: Compile a subset of JaLM (functions, structs, calls, control flow) to WASM; run via a simple host to prove execution."
"Build minimal JaLM runtime for WASM","Goal: Provide runtime support (stack/alloc strategy, panic/trap, string/bytes basics) needed by the standard library."
"Design host interface (WASI + custom web host ABI)","Goal: Decide what uses WASI vs custom imports; define ABI for sockets/http request/response, timers, logging, and cancellation."
"Implement jaLM build tool (jalmt)","Goal: Create CLI commands: new, build, test, run, fmt; produce deterministic builds and a lockfile placeholder."
"Create JaLM standard library core: strings/bytes/collections","Goal: Provide minimal std types (String, Bytes, Vec, Map) and utilities required by web server and JSON."
"Create JaLM std: Result/Option + error conventions","Goal: Define error type pattern, Result propagation syntax, and standard errors for IO/Net/Parse."
"Implement JSON support (parse/serialize)","Goal: Add JSON encode/decode for structs/enums with schema-ish validation hooks; include round-trip tests."
"Implement HTTP server library (router + handlers)","Goal: Provide net/http module with server start, routing, request/response types, middleware chain, and handler signatures that integrate with structured concurrency."
"Implement structured concurrency primitives in std (scope/task)","Goal: Add spawn within scope, join, cancellation tokens, timeout, and ensure request-scoped cancellation works."
"Add logging + tracing basics","Goal: Provide structured logs, request ids, and span timing hooks (exportable to host); ensure logs work in WASM host."
"Create testing framework (jalmt test)","Goal: Define test syntax/annotations, assertions, snapshot-friendly output, and deterministic execution; integrate with runner."
"Create demo web app: Hello + JSON + middleware","Goal: Build an example app that serves a health endpoint and a JSON endpoint, uses middleware, uses structured concurrency, and has tests."
"Implement diagnostics + error codes spec","Goal: Standardize diagnostic codes, message templates, span rendering, and include machine-readable JSON output for tooling/agents."
"Implement language server MVP (LSP)","Goal: Provide LSP features: parse errors, type errors, go-to-def, rename, format-on-save; expose structured diagnostics for agent tooling."
"Add package manager MVP + lockfile","Goal: Support adding deps from a registry stub (or git), produce a lockfile, ensure reproducible builds."
"Security/sandboxing defaults for web host","Goal: Define default denied capabilities, capability grants per package/app, and ensure effect declarations map to host permissions."
"Performance sanity checks + regression harness","Goal: Add basic benchmarks (router throughput, JSON encode/decode) and a CI harness to prevent major regressions."
"Write JaLM MVP docs + tutorials","Goal: Document the language basics, effect system, structured concurrency, and how to build/run the demo app end-to-end."
